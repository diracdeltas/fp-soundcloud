One can still see the affects of the civil war from the worn torn buildings and unrepaired streets.\r\nMaputo is a densely populated city. Yet, when you look toward the countries east\r\ncoast, there are miles and miles of breathtaking coastline along the Indian Ocean.  The people of\r\nMozambique are known worldwide for their positive disposition and outlook.  They tend to take one day\r\nat a time, hoping that each day will be better than the day before.Rafael was born into a family of artists in the Chope and Nhungwe Tribe. Like his ancestors, Rafael is\r\ndedicating his career to the preservation of tradition and culture of his tribe through music and art.   As a\r\nyoungster, instilled by the exposure from family and friends, Rafael developed a passion for music and\r\ndance. He was particularly drawn to African hand-drums and the timbila, an instrument comparable to what\r\nis known as a xylophone.  Still true today, the Chope Tribe is best known for building the timbila. Through a\r\nskillful and tedious process, the timbila is handmade from muenge wood and massala (dry gourds).\r\ndance.

Still true today, the Chope Tribe is best known for building the timbila. Through a\r\nskillful and tedious process, the timbila is handmade from muange wood and massala (dry gourds).\r\nIn his elementary school years, Rafael was further inspired by his teachers to develop his music and dance\r\nskills. He spent many hours after school practicing with peers by flickering candlelight.  \r\nOne of Rafael’s major accomplishments is the co-founding of Xindiro Company, a traditional music and\r\ndance group.  He took on the leadership role of organizing fundraising and securing event sites. The Xindiro\r\nCompany became a sought out group,  At the Annual Drum festival of 2006, the company won the award for\r\nbest overall performance in music and dance.  and have been touring Africa and Europe still.\r\nHis last tour with Company was in 2010 The Netherlands.\r\n\r\nand provide hope and inspiration during a most desperate time.  Rafael participated in numerous\r\nperformances locally and regionally specializing in percussion and timbilia.  By the age of 20, Rafael\r\nauditioned for and subsequently became a member of the professional music and dance group at the\r\nMaputo House of Culture. His leadership skills were apparent and by age 16 he took his first trip outside of\r\nMaputo, participating in a performance at a cultural festival in Swaziland.  Since then he has performed in\r\nSouth Africa, Zimbabwe, Netherlands, and USA, as well as throughout his homeland of\r\nMozambique.

Rafael is very proud and humbled by his accomplishments, sharing\r\nthat it takes “strong collaboration to be successful”.  Rafael’s love for traditional African music and and world music, dance is\r\ninfectious.  He is determined to preserve and inspire others through music and dance. He embraces,\r\nappreciates, and respects the cultural heritage of others.","followers_count":110,"followings_count":233,"first_name":"Rafael","full_name":"Rafael Langa","groups_count":0,"id":4596856,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2017-03-20T11:52:30Z","last_name":"Langa","likes_count":149,"playlist_likes_count":11,"permalink":"rafael-langa","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/rafael-langa","playlist_count":2,"reposts_count":null,"track_count":25,"uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/4596856","urn":"soundcloud:users:4596856","username":"Rafael Langa","verified":false,"visuals":null},{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000323612350-zoqdq6-large.jpg","city":"","comments_count":806,"country_code":null,"created_at":"2015-04-16T23:33:17Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"free"}},"description":"xx.liue@gmail.com\n☜♥☞\n  +\n@friezasama♥♥♥\n@suins\n@coldheaven4ever  \n*   +  ⋆  ✵  . 　\n.　　　　　 .  .   + 　　　　　　　 \n　  　　  ⊹ 　 +   +  \n ·   · 　. 　   ✺  \n ✹   ✫  · 　　  　 .\nuk & trashbin @her","followers_count":2491,"followings_count":450,"first_name":"☜♥☞","full_name":"☜♥☞","groups_count":0,"id":148487013,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2019-03-12T06:59:19Z","last_name":"","likes_count":3868,"playlist_likes_count":32,"permalink":"euil","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/euil","playlist_count":1,"reposts_count":null,"track_count":30,"uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/148487013","urn":"soundcloud:users:148487013","username":"líue","verified":false,"visuals":{"urn":"soundcloud:users:148487013","enabled":true,"visuals":[{"urn":"soundcloud:visuals:31988132","entry_time":0,"visual_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000148487013-590E3o-original.jpg"}]}},{"avatar_url":"http://a1.sndcdn.com/images/default_avatar_large.png?1553099367","city":null,"comments_count":0,"country_code":null,"created_at":"2016-03-21T17:57:52Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"free"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"free"}},"description":null,"followers_count":5,"followings_count":45,"first_name":"","full_name":"","groups_count":0,"id":213505470,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2017-12-04T20:49:37Z","last_name":"","likes_count":24,"playlist_likes_count":3,"permalink":"saintuart","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/saintuart","playlist_count":0,"reposts_count":null,"track_count":0,"uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/213505470","urn":"soundcloud:users:213505470","username":"saintuart","verified":false,"visuals":null},{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000362595071-z05o2y-large.jpg","city":null,"comments_count":6,"country_code":null,"created_at":"2015-10-17T17:19:49Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"free"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"free"}},"description":null,"followers_count":8,"followings_count":48,"first_name":"","full_name":"","groups_count":0,"id":181248401,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2017-12-08T18:13:26Z","last_name":"","likes_count":29,"playlist_likes_count":1,"permalink":"tunanectar","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/tunanectar","playlist_count":0,"reposts_count":null,"track_count":0,"uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/181248401","urn":"soundcloud:users:181248401","username":"TunaNectar","verified":false,"visuals":null},{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000444171441-2veya0-large.jpg","city":null,"comments_count":0,"country_code":null,"created_at":"2013-09-01T22:56:20Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"free"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"free"}},"description":"Apryll Aileen is a Canadian alternative pop rock singer-songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist -- classically trained in piano.\n\nHer sultry vocals, captivating lyrics and alluring stage presence make Apryll a fan favourite at music festivals worldwide. Aileen transcends genres, creating her own undefinable sound with influences coming from pop, rock, blues and jazz. She doesn’t imitate - she creates. A hybrid of two polarities, she blends melodic songwriting and raspy vocal tones from modern artists such as Ellie Goulding and Halsey but performs with intensity, dynamic range and vocal gravel that Stevie Nicks and Janis Joplin would be proud of. \n\nShe does it all from behind a piano but sometimes you may see her bring out a guitar, a synth or maybe even a keytar, if the mood strikes. \n \nWhen Aileen writes songs, she thinks of the collective and voices what others feel but can’t express. With soulful vocals, hooky melodies and raw emotion, her songwriting is inspired by real life events. From pain, to finding inner strength through love, her songs take the listener on a journey through their own inner landscape of being. \n\nThis includes her new single, \"Don't Make Me Wait\" (Oct 2018), a modern-day blend of the 80s and 90s. Written in Venice Beach, California by Perry Rod and Apryll Aileen and produced by Marty Rod, the song shares an upbeat story of being ready for love.\n\n“This song is about the importance of being present and realizing that time isn't infinite,” explains Aileen. “It's about taking risks and not waiting to start that adventure with someone. I’m sure we've all been on the fence before with regards to jumping into love, wondering if we should go for it or not. This song is about being ready to take that chance and dive in with both feet.”\n\nIn 2017, Aileen was nominated as “Pop Artist of the Year” for the Music NB Awards following the release of her debut album, Savannah Soul (2016), and was also a recipient of the YWCA Women of Distinction Award for Arts, Culture & Design. Her debut single, “Hey Sugar” (2016), received cross-Canada airplay and made it to CBC Searchlight’s (annual competition for Canada’s next undiscovered talent), top-25 nationally.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, Aileen had several sync placements in the TV shows “The Next Step” and “Lost & Found Music Studios” (The Family Channel & BBC Worldwide), for her songs “Great Expectations”, “Now is Our Time”, “Keep Me Hangin’”, “Can’t Buy Fame” and “Faith”. Her song “Butterflies” earned the title track on the multiple award-winning film “Butterflies” in 2014 by Emmy® Award-Winning Director Cayman Grant (Oxygen Best Female Director Award, participant in the prestigious NBC/Universal Emerging Directors TV Program, etc.).\n\nAileen spends most of her time performing and writing music between the quiet solitude of New Brunswick in Atlantic Canada and the hustle and bustle of downtown Toronto. When she is not in either, she is usually found on the Venice Beach boardwalk, SoCal style, where her boho spirit and love for the sun and ocean connect.  \n\nShe is currently recording her second album, Home, which will be released in spring/summer 2019.","followers_count":44,"followings_count":173,"first_name":"","full_name":"","groups_count":0,"id":56496365,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2019-03-13T19:08:57Z","last_name":"","likes_count":9,"playlist_likes_count":0,"permalink":"apryllaileen","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/apryllaileen","playlist_count":2,"reposts_count":null,"track_count":22,"uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/56496365","urn":"soundcloud:users:56496365","username":"ApryllAileen","verified":false,"visuals":{"urn":"soundcloud:users:56496365","enabled":true,"visuals":[{"urn":"soundcloud:visuals:48692535","entry_time":0,"visual_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000056496365-vmt4pU-original.jpg"}]}},{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000060410832-v4sn4b-large.jpg","city":"Berkeley","comments_count":4,"country_code":"US","created_at":"2011-07-19T19:05:13Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"free"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"free"}},"description":null,"followers_count":107,"followings_count":568,"first_name":"Piotr","full_name":"Piotr

Since those days, his music has grown, and brought him to international stages from London UK, to the bay area, and back home to Vancouver BC. A few early breakthrough tunes from '07-'09 put his name on the bass music map, with Night Work, Girl Sweat, and his remix of Ginuwine's Pony.

In 2008 he came across a box of 7\" tapes at an estate sale in Altadena that turned out to be field recordings of a turn-of-the century orchestra of ex-miners; recorded almost entirely with hand-made instruments and contact microphones.  This became the source material for a collection of celebrated releases with Hit+Run.  CFO has also appeared on Giles Peterson’s seminal compilation series “Brownswood Bubblers”(Volume 10), and contributed to Ninja Tune’s popular “Solid Steel” mix.   \n\nCFO’S latest edition, “Mapping The Futures Gone By” , furthers their exploration of dubby broken percussion and haunting found sounds.   Sirens and lasers accent plaintive woodwind arrangements set against mbiras and bluesy guitars.  Fitting in a time and place that’s uniquely it’s own, MTFGB is a travelogue to a lucid dream, a mining expedition or a trip to space–somehow nostalgic and familiar, yet somehow not at all.","followers_count":857,"followings_count":208,"first_name":"CFO","full_name":"CFO","groups_count":0,"id":242836,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2018-09-09T15:22:22Z","last_name":"","likes_count":93,"playlist_likes_count":8,"permalink":"contactfieldorchestra","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/contactfieldorchestra","playlist_count":0,"reposts_count":null,"track_count":4,"uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/242836","urn":"soundcloud:users:242836","username":"Contact Field Orchestra","verified":false,"visuals":{"urn":"soundcloud:users:242836","enabled":true,"visuals":[{"urn":"soundcloud:visuals:4042393","entry_time":0,"visual_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000000242836-kBnuNp-original.jpg"}]}},{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000008532313-7o2x98-large.jpg","city":null,"comments_count":3,"country_code":null,"created_at":"2011-12-28T05:34:11Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"free"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"free"}},"description":null,"followers_count":53,"followings_count":168,"first_name":"Bonnie","full_name":"Bonnie Muffington","groups_count":0,"id":10215077,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2015-12-11T20:00:42Z","last_name":"Muffington","likes_count":224,"playlist_likes_count":81,"permalink":"bonbonsuperbonbon","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/bonbonsuperbonbon","playlist_count":1,"reposts_count":null,"track_count":0,"uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/10215077","urn":"soundcloud:users:10215077","username":"Bonnie Muffington","verified":false,"visuals":null},{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000153732914-5aqfnp-large.jpg","city":"Los Angeles","comments_count":156,"country_code":"US","created_at":"2012-07-27T05:09:40Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"free"}},"description":"do what you love.\n\nDont Die At Work is a Record Label/Clothing Company based in Los Angeles. \n\nFree releases + live performances \n\nFounded by @Hitmeupmusic\nDemos/Inquiries: dontdiecrew@gmail.com","followers_count":8227,"followings_count":1343,"first_name":"","full_name":"","groups_count":0,"id":20990177,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2018-10-29T19:21:24Z","last_name":"","likes_count":1499,"playlist_likes_count":81,"permalink":"dontdieatwork","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/dontdieatwork","playlist_count":9,"reposts_count":null,"track_count":64,"uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/20990177","urn":"soundcloud:users:20990177","username":"Dont Die At Work","verified":false,"visuals":{"urn":"soundcloud:users:20990177","enabled":true,"visuals":[{"urn":"soundcloud:visuals:69827","entry_time":0,"visual_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/visuals-000020990177-fc6Bpq-original.jpg"}]}},{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000340642613-1c1rmx-large.jpg","city":null,"comments_count":2,"country_code":null,"created_at":"2014-02-04T16:07:58Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"free"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"free"}},"description":null,"followers_count":11,"followings_count":53,"first_name":"Sophia","full_name":"Sophia Mills","groups_count":0,"id":78627417,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2017-10-19T16:41:25Z","last_name":"Mills","likes_count":76,"playlist_likes_count":12,"permalink":"sophia-mills","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/sophia-mills","playlist_count":2,"reposts_count":null,"track_count":0,"uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/78627417","urn":"soundcloud:users:78627417","username":"Sophia Mills","verified":false,"visuals":null},{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000496156881-vnw3bj-large.jpg","city":"Bogotá / Amsterdam / Washington","comments_count":1705,"country_code":null,"created_at":"2012-06-30T08:40:30Z","creator_subscriptions":[{"product":{"id":"creator-pro-unlimited"}}],"creator_subscription":{"product":{"id":"free"}},"description":"I romanticise charangos & sweat only cadence. \nMusical storytelling by a Colombiana now in Washington D.C. \nFor bookings: Tj@moodmanagement.nl  \n\nColombian\nProducer and Beats Maker\nWomanist because feminist is not enough. \n32% unicorn\n\nLola Villa is a producer and DJ from Bogotá. Her travels have brought her closer to her Afro-Colombian roots, taking the audience on a sonic exploration of the  American and African continent through a digital lens. \n\nWhen playing, Lola invokes landscapes, animals & rituals of her homeland Colombia – a country rich in Amazonian,  Andean,  Afro, and Arab musical legacies. By adding live and acoustic elements to her performances, such as percussions and southern rattles, she sets the tone for engaging and uplifting sets. Her sound is for that reason a profound journey of melodies––a playground of rhythms going beyond genres and geographical boundaries.\n\nShe’s a vivid advocate for an inclusive industry and a safe dancefloor, putting together workshops for aspiring female and non-binary DJs and musical meet-ups in cities such as: Tunis, Lagos, Amsterdam, and Washington D.C. Her philosophy: dance music needs disruption, it needs poetry, it needs people who cannot afford it. Dance needs people of color,  it needs riot girls, and kranky queers. \n\nLola lives in Washington D.C. \n\nFind me here: \n24.03 Flash, Sunday Love, Washington D.C. \n\n\n\nPast: \n08-09 Caravan Festival, Virginia, USA. \n07.01 Conscious Club, Amsterdam\n27.01 Zero Fucks, Public Works, San Francisco\n05.02 Lucid, Berlin\n10.02  Love Foundation, Lisbon, Portugal \n17.02 Satu Mare, Romania\n18.02 Control, Bucharest, Romania\n19.02 Pachamama, Number 9, London\n25.02 Conscious Club, Amsterdam\n18.03 Quito, Ecuador\n27.04 Paradigm, Groningen, The Netherlands\n28.04 Maastricht, Love Foundation, The Netherlands\n03.06 Waterhouse, Amsterdam\n08.07 Georgies Wundergasten, Amsterdam\n17.07 Buiten Westen, Amsterdam\n\n2016\n05.03. @ringanddorf, Schakl-Oase - Festive Spontane, Lighthouse Amsterdam, Netherlands\n10.04  b2b @Garstique @ Jonny Knüppel, Berlin, Germany\n13.04 Slowmotor, LOLAHOI w/@lotteahoi.
